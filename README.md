This program is an implementation of Regular expression parser.
The reg ex charecters used are '.' and '*'.
'.' : Matches every lowercase charecter [a-z]
'*' : Matches the charecter before it 0 or n number of times.

This is just a very simple implementation of Regular expression parser. I made this program to make it easy for beginners to understand the basics of regular expression parser.
Regular reg-ex parsers are way more complex and consist of many more match charecters. This is just a very simple implementation of the reg-ex parser.

The isMatch function takes 2 input strings as its arguments. These are namely the "input string" and the "format string". The format string consists of the reg-ex characters. The function then provides a boolean return value. True : if the format string matches the input string. False : if it doesn't match.
